# AxionReweighting

This is a collection of code used for the reweighting of data to convert data from a higgs portal scalar to an axion producing the same signal, $e^+e^-$.


Axion theory is based on [New bounds on axion-like particles from MicroBooNE](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03447.pdf), which uses chiral perturbation theory to calculate amplitudes and decay widths.

Higgs portal scalar theory is based on the thesis of Aditya Bhanderi's thesis [Search for Low mass Higgs Portal Scalars at the MicroBooNE Detector in the NuMI Beam](https://inspirehep.net/files/625446aaecb90d672b9cf544093566c0).
